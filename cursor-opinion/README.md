# Cursor Opinion Plugin

A Claude Code plugin that lets you get a second opinion from Cursor AI during your conversation with Claude.

## Features

- `/ask-cursor [context]` - Get Cursor's opinion on the current topic (optional additional context)
- `/delegate [task]` - Have Cursor make code changes in your project directory
- `/review` - Send git diff to Cursor for a concise code review
- Automatically gathers conversation context and relevant files
- Creates comprehensive prompts for Cursor with full context
- Claude synthesizes both AI perspectives for better recommendations

## Prerequisites

1. **Cursor CLI** - The `agent` command must be available in your PATH
   - Install Cursor and ensure the CLI is set up

2. **API Key** - Set your Cursor API key as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   # Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
   export CURSOR_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
   ```

## Installation

This plugin is installed locally at `~/.claude/plugins/cursor-opinion/`.

To enable it in Claude Code:
```
/plugin install ~/.claude/plugins/cursor-opinion
```

Or add it to your Claude Code settings.

## Usage

### `/ask-cursor [additional context]`

Get Cursor's opinion on the current topic:
```
/ask-cursor
/ask-cursor what about performance implications?
```

Claude will gather context, consult Cursor, and synthesize both perspectives.

### `/delegate [task description]`

Have Cursor make code changes in your project:
```
/delegate add input validation to the login form
/delegate refactor the API handlers to use async/await
```

Cursor runs with write permissions in your current working directory.

### `/review`

Get a code review of your uncommitted changes:
```
/review
```

Cursor reviews your git diff and provides concise, actionable feedback.

## Configuration

Environment variables for customization:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CURSOR_API_KEY` | (required) | Your Cursor API key |
| `CURSOR_MODEL` | `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` | Model for Cursor to use |
